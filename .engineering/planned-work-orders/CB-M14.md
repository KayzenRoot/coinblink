# Planned Work Order CB-M14 · Security, Reliability & Platform Operations

**Stage:** P1 cross-cutting module  
**Status:** PROPOSED / NOT ADMITTED  
**Execution model:** GEF Bootstrap v1.1.2; Codex authoring when available; no execution claim from planning artifact.  
**Preview route(s):** `/admin/ops, /admin/audit, /admin/security`  
**Dependencies:** CB-M00; CB-M05; CB-M03.

## Objective
Observable reliable portal with secure secrets, rollback and durable backup.

## Source hierarchy / context
Read `AGENTS.md`, `.engineering/SOURCE-HIERARCHY.md`, current admitted GEF Checkpoint and Context Lock, full owner-approved Visual Bible and image manifest, `docs/product/ROADMAP_AND_MODULE_CATALOG_v0.1.md`, `docs/product/CONTINUOUS_VISUAL_DELIVERY_PROTOCOL_v0.1.md`, the active Decision Ledger, and the specific module's contracts. Never use historical brainstorm as approved scope.

## Admitted boundary
ADMISSION STATUS: PROPOSED, NOT EXECUTABLE until CB-PLAN-001 architecture/product scopes are approved, active module Context Lock compiled, exact base HEAD pinned, dependency review and GEF preflight passed.

## End-to-end implementation deliverables
1. Threat model for auth, provider feeds, admin content, uploaded media, external customer API, billing webhooks and social OAuth tokens.
2. Role-based permissions, MFA support, CSRF/CORS/CSP, anti-SSRF when fetching feeds, file upload scanning and content sanitization.
3. Structured logs, traces, source/queue health, error budgets, SLO definitions, alert and incident response runbooks with status center.
4. Backups/disaster restore test, data migrations, rollback and staging-to-production promotion workflow, deploy compatibility contracts.
5. Cost observability for providers, Cloudflare, AI, storage, egress and API subscriptions and automatic usage circuit breakers.
6. Dependency scans, secret scans, rate/performance/stress tests, supply chain provenance/lockfile and audit retention schedules.

## Data, contracts and privacy
Define the module's database entities/schema migrations, normalized events, role permissions, public/internal API contracts (if applicable), fixture strategy, latency/cache behavior, accessibility treatment, copyright/licensing provenance, data retention, error observability and secret boundaries. No new external paid services or posting/revenue side effects without approved ADR and explicit owner permission. Integrations start sandbox/mock and promote by a separated, documented external verification gate.

## Long Work Order execution and milestones
- **P0 · Vertical visual shell:** concrete navigation, route(s) /admin/ops, /admin/audit, /admin/security; fixture data clearly labeled; compare with current design system. Commit and publish Preview, collect screenshot/health evidence.
- **P1 · Functional complete slice:** functional persistence/API/validations/workflows/permissions, provider fallbacks, meaningful content and action states. Add E2E and contract tests, update screenshots; debug in this same WO, not an unrelated WO.
- **P2 · Quality/production gates:** roles, privacy, abuse, performance, cost budget, a11y, import/export and rollback as relevant; collect owner feedback, resolve all actionable P1/P2, assert exact HEAD and repeat CI/Preview.
- **Milestone discipline:** one module PR with intermediate commits and screenshot links; STOP when a failed gate cannot be responsibly corrected within this same scope. Don't artificially split one coherent module across many repetitive WOs; also avoid massive cross-module PRs.

## Module-specific acceptance criteria
1. Pentest threat checklist.
2. Critical zero-known-exploits within scope.
3. Restore rehearsal succeeds.
4. Cost alert and kill switch tested.
5. Owner audit and incident documentation.

## Required verification / evidence
Use repeatable unit/integration/E2E Playwright tests, accessibility checks, security negative cases, exact-head CI and deployed Worker Preview smoke. Evidence Bundle must include base/head SHA, provider mocks vs live status, URL, one screenshot per viewport (1536x864/390x844/768x1024), test logs, known gaps, costs, license/consent restrictions, correction count and next legal action.

## Out of scope
Other modules, legal publication rights not covered by this module, cross-module schema refactors without ADR, and creating a live public launch merely because the Preview works. Secrets stay out of Git. Demo quotes/news/stats are visibly mocked until backed by approved providers.

## Definition of Done and STOP
STOP CONDITION: code and UI actually running in PR preview, acceptance validated, documented review and all critical defects corrected on same PR, owner visual/function approval or explicit bounded delegation, exact-head CI green, checkpoint delta proposed and only then merge. If external app review, API payment, cloud account, secrets, image rights, or unapproved ADR blocks it, mark BLOCKED and retain a useful mock-mode preview with explicit badges; never fake live deployment, monetization or data.

## Review payload template
`CB-M14 | BASE_SHA | HEAD_SHA | P0_PREVIEW | P1_FUNCTIONAL | P2_TESTS | EVIDENCE_BUNDLE | LIVE_VS_MOCK | PRIVACY/LICENSING | RISKS | EXACT_HEAD_CI | VERDICT | CHECKPOINT_DELTA | NEXT_ACTION`

> This planned WO is intentionally long and module-wide. It becomes executable only after freezing its contract/ADR/dependencies and fingerprinted Context Lock. No blanket self-approval.
